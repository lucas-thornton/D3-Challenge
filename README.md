# D3-Challenge

This project aims to create an interactive graph that compares various health factors (obesity rate, smoking rate and healthcare) with three demographic factors (income, age, poverty rate) across all states in the US.

Clicking on the axis labels will shift the axis and values of the circle to show the scatter plot for those values. If you hover over the circles on the graph it will also show you the state name and specific values for that marker.
